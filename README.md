## Overview of the Analysis 

The objective of this analysis is to gather information on the temperature trends before opening a surf shop in which the business would be impacted by frequent inclement weather. Temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu were gathered to determine sustainability of the shop. 

## Results 

### Statistics for June

The summary statistics for the month of June identify several critical components, including the average temperature being 74.9 degrees, as well as information on standard deviation and quartiles.

### Analysis 

The distribution and range of values are compared using the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values, and quartiles. June reported 183 more data points in the calculation for the summary statistics. 

•	The mean temperature between the two months (six months apart) differs only by 3.9 degrees with December being a slightly lower temp. 

•	The standard deviations represent that the temperatures in December have a wider variation from the average temperature than those in June. 

•	The minimum and maximum points provide information about the lowest and highest temperatures. The lowest temperature reported for June was 64 degrees compared to 56 degrees in December. The highest temperature reported for June was 85 degrees compared to only two degrees less in December, 83 degrees. 

### Summary 

Overall, the temperature data between June and December in Oahu does not represent significant differences. As one would expect, the weather in December cooler than June, but only by an average of less than 4 degrees. While the minimum temperatures recorded between the two months differ by 8 degrees, there is not a significant difference in the overall representations in quartiles. 
To dive deeper into analyzing the sustainability of a shop in Oahu, it would be important to look at other climate considerations like precipitation, the threat of flooding, and the potential for wind damage.
